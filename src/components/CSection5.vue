              As mentioned earlier in this report, Sam has been struggling to compare
              items in terms of length, weight, etc. However, looking at skills that Sam
              is developing in other areas, we can see some commonalities.&nbsp;<br />

              Aside from comparing items in terms of length and weight, Sam also finds
              creating a teen number with ones cubes and ten sticks challenging. These
              Learning Gaps are, in part, reflecting Sam’s current stage of behavioral
              development. On the Behavior grid, Sam has Neutral (0) or Mostly Untrue (-1)
              ratings for sociability and sharing. He doesn’t often make use of pair work
              and is hesitant to ask others for help, or to use their cubes/ counting
              blocks/sticks. This has impaired his ability to demonstrate his knowledge
              and effectively practice the skills above.<br />

              With the correct type of support and practice into his Behavior metrics, we
              can expect to see an increase in development and expect to reach mastery of
              comparing items in terms of length and weight in the following 8 weeks.
              <br />
              <br />Additionally, we expect that Sam will also improve in these other
              areas with this support: <br />- Combining and separates quantities of
              objects <br />- Identifying and naming teen numbers when the number is shown
              with a visual representation <br />- Understanding and using the concept of
              a unit
              <br />
              <br />Sam tries to excel at what he does according to his Personality
              survey. We expect he will be receptive to the targeted support he receives
              in class, as well as these recommended support activities to do at home.<br />

              It’s important to note that all children do tend to develop these skills at
              different paces. We will continue to monitor and support Sam in this
              area.<br />
